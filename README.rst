django-powerdns-dnssec
===================================

Welcome to the PowerDNS app for Django.

This application allows easy administration of PowerDNS records stored in an
SQL database by leveraging the standard Django Admin app. You may also use the
Django PowerDNS application as part of a larger project to programatically
modify your DNS records.

**Note:** This is an updated and enhanced fork of `django-powerdns
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-powerdns/>`_ which looks abandoned as of
November 2012.
